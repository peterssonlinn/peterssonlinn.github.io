## About Me

**_Hi, I'm Linn Petersson_**

Right now I am studiying a master in scince in infromation technology at Link√∂ping Universite, Sweden. I am at my fourth year and have one year left. Currently I am in Eindhoven and doing an exchange at TUE. When I am not studying I love to go on trips with friends and family, workout or reading. Min thought with this blog is an simple way of collecting memories and thoughts. If I sound intresing checkout [my resume](CV.pdf) or [write me an email](mailto:linn@pajp.net).
