## About Me

**_Hi, I'm Linn Petersson_**

Right now I am studying Information technology at Link√∂ping University, Sweden. I am in my fourth year and have one year left. Currently, I am in Eindhoven and doing an exchange at TU/e. When I am not studying I love to go on trips with friends and family, work out or read. Min thought with this blog is a simple way of collecting memories and thoughts. If I sound interesting checkout [out my resume](CV.pdf) or [write me an email](mailto:linn@pajp.net).
